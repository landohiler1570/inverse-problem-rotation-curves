# Inverse-Problem Limits in Galaxy Rotation Curve Inference

This repository documents a completed technical analysis of inference limits
in galaxy rotation curve and gravitational lensing studies.

The work examines the inverse-problem structure of these observation channels
and identifies which quantities are directly constrained by data and which
remain underdetermined due to non-invertible measurement mappings.

The analysis demonstrates that extreme parameter-space collapse (including
cases with very rare surviving models) does not imply unique reconstruction
of underlying three-dimensional mass geometry.

No new physical theories are proposed. No claims of unique galaxy structure
are made. All results operate within standard assumptions used in rotation
curve analysis and gravitational dynamics.

The contents are intended as a boundary reference for inverse-problem
reasoning, helping distinguish data-constrained quantities from
model-dependent interpretations.
